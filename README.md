# Raisin Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for supervised and unsupervised machine learning models applied to the raisin dataset. The project explores various aspects of the dataset, including predictive modeling, clustering, and classification.

## Features
- Supervised learning models
- Unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Data preprocessing and imputation

## Requirements
